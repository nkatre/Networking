Contents of the Router Table
1) Subnet id
2) Next Hop port humber
3) Cost to reach destination

PLEASE NOTE that a router also has ARP table to store the MAC addresses. If MAC address of a device is unkown to the Router, then
the Router does an ARP and gets the MAC address and then forwards the packet to that specific device.

How IP packets are routed in a LAN (VERY VERY IMP VIDEO)

VERY IMP NOTE: The router processes the packet UPTO network layer (that means from down it can make changes to datalink layer
(hardware or MAC address) and can also make changes to network layer(that is IP address) of the packet, 
whereas the switch can process the packet upto the datalink layer(that is it can change the hardware or the MAC address
but not the IP address)
