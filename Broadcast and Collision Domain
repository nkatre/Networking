Collision Domain
Def -> Any domain in which simultaneous transmissions are possible are called Collision Domain. (That is any set of links where
we will see simultaneous transmissions)

- layer 1 of the OSI model
 
 
- a hub is an entire collision domain since it forwards every bit it receives from one interface on every other interfaces
 
 
- a bridge is a two interfaces device that creates 2 collision domains, since it forwards the traffic it receives
from one interface only to the interface where the destination layer 2 device (based on his mac address) is connected to.
A bridge is considered as an "intelligent hub" since it reads the destination mac address in order to forward the traffic 
only to the interface where it is connected
 
 
- a switch is a multi-interface hub, every interface on a switch is a collision domain. A 24 interfaces switch creates 
24 collision domains (assuming every interface is connected to something, VLAN don't have any importance here since VLANs
are a layer 2 concept, not layer 1 like collision domains)
 
 
Broadcast Domain :
Def -> Set of all the ports reachable by "broadcast frame" is said to be a Broadcast domain.
 
 
- layer 2 of the OSI model
 
 
- a switch creates an entire broadcast domain (provided that there's only one VLAN) since broadcasts are a layer 2 
concept (mac address related)
 
 
- routers don't forward layer 2 broadcasts, hence they separate broadcast domains
 
With all this information, you can say that on your diagram, there are 2 broadcast domains
(1 router that separates 2 LAN segments composed by one or many switches, with only 1 VLAN per segment).
 
 
There are 8 collision domains, one per pair of devices connected to each other
(switch to router, switch to swich, switch to computer etc...) since we are talking about layer 1 concept (physical connection).
