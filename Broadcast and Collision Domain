With a hub every connected device is in the same collision domain and the same broadcast domain. 
With a switch* every connected device is in the same broadcast domain but there is either a seperate collision domain
for each port (if the links are half duplex) or no collision domain at all (if the links are full duplex) 
With a router the ports are seperate IP subnets and broadcasts are not usually passed from one network to another
(though it is often possible to configure the router to pass them and it can be usefull to do so in some circumstances) 

Source -> Viniotis Notes
Hubs : Incase of Hubs, if any one transmits all or any other interface can sense the transmission, hence the Hub has a single
collision domain
Incase of Hubs, the broadcast packets sent to any one port is sent to all the ports. Hence the Hub has a single broadcast domian

Switches : Incase of switches, the ping packet sent to any one port is sent to all the ports except the port from which
it originated. Hence the Switch has a single Broadcast Domain
Incase of the Switched, each port can sense simultaneous transmission, hence every interface of the switch is a Collision Domain
i.e. No of Collision Domains=No of ports or interfaces on the Switch

Routers:
Every port of a Router is in a SEPARATE(very imp word) Collision Domian(every interface represents a subnet where 
collision can occur i.e. within a subnet, collision can occur)
Hence No of Collision Domains=No of ports or interfaces on the Router
Every port of a Router is in a SEPARATE(very imp word) Broadcast domain (every interface represents a subnet which 
is a broadcast domain)
Hence No of Broadcast Domains=No of ports or interfaces on the Router
