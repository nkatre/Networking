**Roting Protocols Layer(Source: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/14911):**
IS-IS runs over the data link layer (layer 2 )
OSPF, IGRP, and EIGRP run directly over IP (layer 3) But  OSPF and EIGRP have their own reliable transmission mechanism while IGRP assumed an unreliable transport
RIP runs over UDP (layer 4) .
BGP runs over TCP (layer 4) .
